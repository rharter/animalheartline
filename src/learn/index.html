        <h1>About Animal Heartline</h1>
        <p>
          Animal Heartline Humane Assoc. was founded by a small group of animal lovers who were
          individually helping stray and abandoned animals. Becoming chartered in 1979 as a
          humane society and officially recognized as a not-for-profit enabled us to care for
          more animals. We are a no-kill organization staffed entirely by volunteers who are
          dedicated to finding homes for stray and unwanted pets. We obtain medical treatment
          for the pets and provide them with food and shelter until permanent, loving homes
          are found.
