    We have had Ernie (fifty pound - Basset Hound/Rottweiler mix) over two and
    a half years now!
    When we were first invited to meet him, he was so small and so frightened.
    He had one small 
    safe zone and he would not wander very far from it. He was not sure he even
    wanted to be looked
    at let alone touched or held. We fell in love with the little guy immediately.
    Thank you for agreeing that our 
    home was a good fit for his unique needs. <br><br>
    
    We had to put down our sixteen year old Fred (Wire 
    Haired Terrier/Springer Spaniel mix from Metro East Humane Society, 
    Edwardsville, IL) shortly after Ernie's arrival, so they did not have much
    time to bond.
    However, he and his other housemate, Freda (then a ten year old
    Border Collie/Cocker Spaniel mix from the Kenosha County Humane Society,
    Kenosha, WI),
    hit it off right away. They have developed an almost human big sister/little
    brother 
    relationship. <br>
    <br>
    Ernie's third birthday was July 27, 2009. He has come a long way in the past
    couple of years,
    but he is still easily frightened and does not like new people or situations.
    BUT once he trusts 
    you, you are a friend for life! When surprised or startled, he cowers. There
    is not an aggressive
    bone in his body. He is very smart and a fast learner, but sometimes you
    can just see his inner struggles and
    he wants to be brave and friendly, but something very strong holds him back. 
    <br>
    <br>
    At home he is a boisterous and happy guy. It is 
hard to imagine life without him; isn't that the way it 
should be? 
Thank you again for bringing Ernie into our lives, <br><br>
Jim and Judy Campbell <br>

          <img src="../images/2009/happy_tails/sprocket1.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="1"><br><br>
  </div>It's been around six months since we adopted Sprocket and as you can see from his picture he is very happy.  His fur is a little damp around the edges from constantly playing with his big sister Gypsy (an 87 pound
German Shepherd mix).  He has developed quite the personality.  There is a large assortment of sounds he makes when no one is paying attention to him and he can go on and on.  We swear he trying to talk to us (and Gypsy). His collar jangles so we take it off when we go to bed.  This seems to upset him and gets really excited when he hears us pick it up to put it back on him in the morning.  Walking on a leash without pulling is not a problem since he learned at Gypsy's side, but he thinks "sit" means "touch my behind to the floor for about one second".  He'll stay sitting longer if his treat is withheld.  No treat - the one second rule applies!  Oh well, at least he stays, even if he is standing.   He is quite the character and we are very fortunate to have him in our family.

      Hi Jennifer,
Just wanted to wish you and your family a Merry Christmas! Daisy is doing great.
      We completed our training classes through the intermediate and we will
      continue on to advanced once Daisy mellows out a little more!! Here are
      a few pics. Thank you again for doing what you do and bringing her into

	  Hi Debbie,
                <br>
                <br>
                We moved to Cincinnati two years ago and were able to get him
                out of the apartment in Oak Park. He really loves having a house
                to run around in with a fenced in back yard. We were in the new
                house for about two months when a visitor kept coming up to our
                screen door and saying hello to him. A young kitten was living
                in the bush outside of our house and she became attached to Levi
                immediately. It turned out that she belonged to the neighbor's
                daughter, who moved away. So, we took her in and she became Levi's
                sister Cleo. I'm attaching a picture of the two of them together
                for you to see. We take both of them back to Illinois when we
                go visit. They are almost inseparable. They are sleeping on the
                bed together right now. He's doing so well though. We have a
                spot for him to look out the window all day long. Usually, he
                and Cleo are up there together
                until Nanci or I come back from wherever we have gone. He's turned
                our guest room into his bone area, and he likes to hide his treats
                in the comforter on the bed. Nanci and I are expecting our first
                baby in August, and we'll have to get Levi used to that. He's
                really great with kids, but up until now, he's been the baby.
                Cleo is an extremely affectionate cat and she is almost like
                another dog. But Levi is like our first born. We took him to
                a baby shower, and one of our other couple friends brought their
                three week old. When nobody was looking, Levi snuck over to the
                baby and planted a huge lick right on her face. Can you imagine opening your eyes for the first time, only to see a beagle getting ready to lick you?
                But he's definitely the spoiled member of the family. My Mom passed away last summer and she loved Levi. She was never a fan of animals, but Levi was different. When she was sick, Levi would sleep in bed with her and sit on her lap. My parents would buy him raw hides and toys for whenever he came to visit. Levi was usually the first thing she would ask about when I called home. Mom was a big fan of emailing distant friends and relatives and she used to send pictures of him to everyone. We took Levi back to Illinois for the funeral services and everyone thought he was her dog. It was hilarious- that was how much she loved Levi.
                We always tell people that he is related to Uno- the Westminster Champ. My great Uncle runs hunting beagles and he wants to make Levi one of his team. lol. We tell him that Levi is too philosophical for that.
                Anyway, thanks for checking in with us and Levi. He's getting ready for spring time. We have alot of snow down here, which he doesn't like because his legs are too short.
                I am attaching some pictures for you.

        Hey Jen and the rest of Animal Heartline!  First off Krystle and I want
        to say Thank You! We can not express enough how happy we are to have
        Dice in our life and be a part of his! He is an absolutely wonderful
        dog and we couldn't be happier with our decision to adopt him! Mikey,
        his brother, and him get along pretty well. Mikey is an older dog and
        can be a litle grumpy but they co exist well and at times even play together.
        We have had my parents dog Lucy over and my parents have also spent time
        watching Dice at their place. Lucy and him get along great! Dice likes
        to hoard all of the rawhides but other than they are great playmates.
        Due to the unfortunate and unexpected death of Krystles father Ray we
        have been spending quite some time at Krystle's parents house with her
        stepmom. They have a fenced in back yard and have two other dogs there.
        Dice has been getting alot of exercise and alot of play time with them.
        We are looking forward to a summer full of camping, dog parks, and maybe
        even the beach. His knee still bothers him sometimes but we are watching
        it carefully and waiting for him to finish growing. We have attached
        some pictures and video of Dice and his siblings for you too see of !
        Once again thank you so much for adopting Dice to us!

          <br>

        <br>
          After visiting PAWS and Anti-Cruelty Society in
            Chicago every weekend for 3 months for my first dog adoption, I hadn't
            found 'my dog' yet. While searching the internet, I came upon Petfinder.com
            and plugged in the type of dog I was looking for. <br>
            <br>
            After scrolling through hundreds of pictures over the course of a
            week, I saw the most unusal and intriguing face. When I clicked on
            Casey, I saw him playing with his foster family's young daughter
            and saw his gentle nature. It was important for me that a dog be
            good with young kids since my brother has four. It was the wonderful
            description that really captured my attention discussion how the
            shelter staff had raved about his personality and temperament.<br>
            <br>
            Christina and her husband brought Casey down to the city (his first
            time in an urban setting with all kinds of sounds and noises to spook
            him) for my family and I to meet him. While obviously shy at first,
            Christina was smart enough to capture my niece's approval by giving
            her some food to feed him which he devoured and licked her hand incessantly.
            The deal was done.<br>
            <br>
            Now it's 10 months later and I can't imagine this sweet boy not being
            in my life. Fortunately, he's able to come to work with me daily
            and I think our bond is rock solid based on the time we spendt together.
            How someone could even consider giving him up is beyond me, but I'm
            blessed they did.<br>
            <br>
            I want to thank Christina and the wonderful people at Animal Heartline
            for bringing Casey into my life and giving myself and my family so
            much joy each and every day. I want to express my appreciation for
            the foster family for house training him and giving him the ability
            to trust a new environment since I understand he was bounced around
            early in his life. I couldn't ask for a more special, loving, devoted,
            and charismatic dog....especially being a first time owner.<br>
            <br>
            Thank you again and please don't stop your mission of placing these
            wonderful animals in loving homes.<br>
            <br>

                an
                update. He is doing wonderful. He adjusted fine to our busy family
                atmosphere. He loves the boys and vice versa. They have him running
                and playing from the time he gets up in the morning to the time 
                he goes

                to bed. He 
                is completely housebroken and did very well in obedience
                classes. We put a small pond in our back yard in the fall and 
                of course
                Moby thinks this is his drinking well and swimming hole. He is
                approximately 30 pounds of love at this point. He 
                is a great dog! We
                love him! I hope all your other adoptions are going just as well.<br>

          <br>Hi Norma,<br>
            <br>
            I hope all is going well for you. My son nicknamed Samson, Tank (I 
            am sure you know why). When we were in Kohl's we saw this tank pillow 
            and thought Samson aka Tank would like it so we purchased it for him 
            (not spoiled of course). I thought you would like to see him sleeping 
            with his name sake. He is such a character now that Breana moved in 
            with her two kitties. He is scared of the little one but jumps the 
            bigger one. He loves being in the room with all of them I think it 
            reminds him of old times. Well, have a good evening!<br>

Hello 
            Animal Heartline Gang!!!!<br><br>

         I thought 
            I would take a moment to give you an update on Teeko. We are so happy
             to have him in our family! He is our little gift.
          <br>
<br>
Teeko 
            has accomplished a lot over the past week. After only one day he
            was walking on the leash right alongside Shiloh. We have been crating
            him at night and he has been sleeping completely through the night
            since Thursday. He will play fetch for as long as you are willing.
            Teeko&#146;s 
            personality has really started to come out. He is so cuddly and sweet
             but also loves to run, jump and play. He is definitely a terrier.
            
            He is already &#147;defending&#148; the yard from passing pedestrians
             and cyclists. This weekend we took him to the pet store to buy him
            
            some sweaters for winter and a carrying bag. No matter how many sweaters
             we tried on him or bags we put him in, he sat perfectly still content
            
            with the attention. He&#146;s the same way when I brush him. He is
            happy and healthy and we couldn&#146;t be more pleased with our new
             little boy. I hope that the other yorkies bring their new families
            
            as much happiness as Teeko has brought to us. Thank you for working
             so well with Lora and I and we will keep you posted on Teeko&#146;s
            progress.<br><br>
